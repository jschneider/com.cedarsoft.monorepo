Sample

  This is a very simple example that shows how cedarsoft Serialization works. This sample is based on {{{stax-mate/}Stax Mate}}.

* The business object

  We can serialize all kinds of business objects. cedarsoft Serialization just provides the structure while the specific code
  is hand written.

  In this sample we serialize a simple money object with just one value:

%{snippet|id=fieldsAndConstructors|file=samples/stax-mate/src/main/java/com/cedarsoft/test/Money.java}

* The resulting XML

  This is a sample XML that is created by a very simple serializer:

+---
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<money xmlns=""http://www.cedarsoft.com/test/money/1.0.0">>1199</money>
+---

  The second line defines a namespace that contains the format version. If the XML format has to be changed,
  the version number is increased.

  The design of cedarsoft Serialization offers a very easy way to handle the old formats, too.

* The serialization class

  For each business class there should be one serializer. So for our <Money> class we create the class <MoneySerializer>.
  The creation of this serializer and test stubs can be done using the {{{./generator.html}generator}}.
