Generator

  To avoid unnecessary manual work, it is possible to generate Serializers for your domain classes.

  The Generator allows you to "save-a-lot-of-work-but-still-have-the-power" approach.

* Maven Plugin

  The recommended way is to use the {{{./generator/serializer-generator-maven-plugin}Maven plugin}}.

  Using this plugin is the easiest way - no special configurations are needed. Just invoke the plugin and you are done.


* Manual invocation

  It is also possible to invoke the generator manually. Therefore the executable generator jar has to be downloaded from

  {{{http://nexus.cedarsoft.com/content/groups/public/com/cedarsoft/serialization/generator/stax-mate/${currentStableVersion}/stax-mate-all.jar}generator.jar}}
