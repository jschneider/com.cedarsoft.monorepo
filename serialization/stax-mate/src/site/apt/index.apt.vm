Stax Mate based Serializers
      
  Stax Mate is a small extension to Stax that offers an improved API to serialize XML. The code looks a bit cleaner and it
  is saving you a few key strokes.

  Since it is based on Stax you get the same performance.

  Serializers should extend {{{../xref/com/cedarsoft/serialization/stax/AbstractStaxMateSerializer.html}<AbstractStaxMateSerializer>}}.
